# Car-evaluation-dataset

The core of this research is a hierarchically structured dataset produced by a decision process created exclusively for evaluating cars. The model outlines evaluation standards for pricing dynamics, upkeep expenses, and safety standards. In essence, this dataset serves as the starting point for a careful exploration of a variety of machine learning techniques.
This project includes details about cars and their characteristics. These can be used to forecast their acceptance or categorization into various groups. This dataset contains attributes or features that provide us with useful information about the cars, including their purchase price, maintenance costs, the number of doors and seats they have, the size of their luggage boot, their safety levels, and their class designation, which denotes their acceptability.
